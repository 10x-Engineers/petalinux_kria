# Customize PetaLinux
## Overview
We modified PetaLinux (2022.1) provided in the 
[zynqmp_cam_isp_demo_linux](https://github.com/bxinquan/zynqmp_cam_isp_demo_linux.git) project, resolved all dependencies, and installed the necessary packages to run our developed libcamera-based application, [custom-camera-application](https://github.com/10xEngineersTech/custom-camera-application.git).  

For detail, how to use it to build the application on Kria board, we have written a [tutorial](https://10xengineers.ai/updates/).
